# Success Metrics & Validation

## MVP Success Metrics:
- Core redaction flow: User can mark, apply, and download a truly redacted PDF without backend or upload.
- No information leak: Redacted content is visually and technically unrecoverable in output file (not just "covered up").
- UX smoothness: Users can toggle, undo, and clear redactions with intuitive, discoverable actions.
- Performance: Tool loads and updates PDF within 1â€“2 seconds on standard hardware (local, sample PDF).
- Zero user confusion: Users can distinguish between original and redacted view, and know which they are downloading.

## Validation Methods:
- Manual QA: Attempt to "recover" redacted content (should be impossible).
- User testing: Short feedback cycle with non-technical testers.
- Accessibility check: Ensure keyboard navigation works for critical actions (at least as a smoke test).
- Code audit: Confirm no temp or unredacted versions leak beyond browser memory.
