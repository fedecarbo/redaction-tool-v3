# Project Overview & Goals

## Web-Based PDF Redaction Tool (MVP)

Build a web-based PDF redaction tool as an MVP, enabling users to view a sample PDF, activate "redact mode," select rectangular areas to redact, confirm the redaction, and view/download either the original or fully redacted PDF—all directly in the browser.

### Goals:
- Deliver a seamless, trustworthy redaction experience—no file uploads, all in-browser.
- Empower users to test and use core redaction features with zero backend or account setup.
- Ensure permanent, visual redaction that cannot be reversed by typical PDF viewers.
- Provide a polished, modern UI with familiar PDF viewer controls.
