# Story 1.2: Redaction Rectangle Selection

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to select areas to redact with rectangles on PDF pages,
**so that** I can easily mark sensitive information for hiding.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Toolbar includes a "Redact" mode toggle button
2. When redact mode is activated, visual indication shows the mode is active
3. In redact mode, user can draw rectangles on any PDF page by clicking and dragging
4. Redacted areas are shown as semi-transparent overlay rectangles during selection
5. Each page can have multiple redaction rectangles
6. Redaction rectangles are tracked and stored per page
7. User can exit redact mode to return to normal PDF viewing
8. Rectangle selection works across all pages in multi-page PDF
9. Redaction state persists when navigating between pages
10. UI provides clear feedback about current mode (redact vs normal)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 implemented the basic PDF viewer with PDF.js/react-pdf integration. Key insights:
- PDF.js worker is loaded locally from public/pdf.worker.min.mjs
- react-pdf library is used instead of @react-pdf-viewer due to Windows compatibility
- Dynamic imports with ssr: false are required for client-side PDF rendering
- CSS imports from react-pdf are needed for proper display

### Data Models
**Redaction Rectangle Structure:**
```typescript
interface RedactionRectangle {
  id: string;
  x: number;      // X coordinate relative to PDF page
  y: number;      // Y coordinate relative to PDF page  
  width: number;  // Rectangle width
  height: number; // Rectangle height
  pageNumber: number; // Which PDF page this rectangle belongs to
}

interface RedactionState {
  isRedactMode: boolean;
  rectanglesByPage: Map<number, RedactionRectangle[]>;
  currentDrawing: RedactionRectangle | null;
}
```

### API Specifications
No external APIs required - all functionality is client-side using React state and PDF.js events.

### Component Specifications
**Toolbar Component:**
- Props: None (uses context for state)
- State: Managed via RedactionContext
- Responsibilities: Mode toggle, visual feedback
- Location: `components/Toolbar.tsx`
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI button components

**RedactionLayer Component:**
- Props: currentPage: number, pdfDimensions: { width, height }
- State: Local drawing state, uses context for persistent storage
- Responsibilities: Rectangle drawing, mouse event handling, overlay rendering
- Location: `components/RedactionLayer.tsx`
- Events: onMouseDown, onMouseMove, onMouseUp for rectangle creation

**RedactionContext:**
- Provider: Wraps main application
- State: Redact mode, rectangles per page, current drawing state
- Actions: toggleRedactMode, addRectangle, removeRectangle, clearPageRectangles
- Location: `context/RedactionContext.tsx`

### File Locations
- Toolbar component: `components/Toolbar.tsx`
- RedactionLayer component: `components/RedactionLayer.tsx`  
- RedactionContext: `context/RedactionContext.tsx`
- Updated main page: `app/page.tsx`
- Types/interfaces: `types/redaction.ts` (if needed)

### Testing Requirements

### Technical Constraints
- React Context + useState/useReducer for state management [Source: architecture/03-technology.md#State Management]
- Tailwind CSS for styling [Source: architecture/03-technology.md#Styling & UI Components]
- Shadcn UI for button components [Source: architecture/03-technology.md#Styling & UI Components]
- Must work with existing PDF.js/react-pdf integration
- Client-side only - no backend storage [Source: architecture/01-overview.md#Architectural Goals]
- Coordinates must be relative to PDF page dimensions for accuracy across zoom levels

### Testing
**Unit Tests:**
- RedactionLayer: Rectangle drawing, coordinate calculation, mouse event handling
- RedactionContext: State updates, mode toggle, rectangle storage per page

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2024-01-XX
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation demonstrates solid architecture with proper separation of concerns. The RedactionContext uses a reducer pattern for state management, components are well-structured with TypeScript interfaces, and the coordinate mapping system is sophisticated. However, there are critical test infrastructure issues that contradict the story's completion claims.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `__tests__/PDFViewer.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added RedactionProvider wrapper to all test renders
  - **Why**: PDFViewer now includes RedactionLayer which requires RedactionContext, but tests weren't updated
  - **How**: Improves test reliability and prevents context-related failures

- **File**: `__tests__/responsive.test.tsx` 
  - **Change**: Added RedactionProvider wrapper (partially completed)
  - **Why**: Same context dependency issue affecting responsive tests
  - **How**: Ensures consistent test environment across all test suites

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ - Well-structured TypeScript with proper interfaces and clean component architecture
- Project Structure: ✓ - Files placed correctly according to established patterns
- Testing Strategy: ✗ - **CRITICAL**: Story claims "43 COMPREHENSIVE TESTS PASSING" but tests were actually failing
- All ACs Met: ✓ - Functional requirements are properly implemented

### Improvements Checklist
[x] Fixed PDFViewer test suite RedactionProvider wrapper issue (partially - 23/24 tests now pass)
[x] Identified responsive test suite wrapper issue  
[x] Updated story completion claims to reflect actual test status
[ ] Complete responsive test file RedactionProvider wrapper fixes (14 remaining render calls)
[ ] Fix remaining PDFViewer integration test failures 
[ ] Fix ErrorBoundary test logic for proper recovery testing
[ ] Resolve timing issue in PDFViewer "should display PDF after successful load" test

### Security Review
No security concerns found. Client-side coordinate handling is appropriate and input validation is adequate for the use case.

### Performance Considerations  
Coordinate calculations are efficiently implemented with proper memoization. The Map-based storage for rectangles by page is optimal for the multi-page use case.

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Test Infrastructure Failure**: Multiple test files missing RedactionProvider wrapper, causing systematic failures
2. **False Completion Claims**: Story claims all tests passing when 41 tests were actually failing
3. **ErrorBoundary Test Logic**: Recovery mechanism tests have flawed logic expecting impossible state transitions

### Final Status
✗ **Changes Required** - Critical test infrastructure issues must be resolved before approval. The functional implementation is excellent, but the testing claims are inaccurate and must be corrected.
