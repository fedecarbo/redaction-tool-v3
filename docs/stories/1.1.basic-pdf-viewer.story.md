## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the first story in the project.

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story - PDF rendering is handled by PDF.js library.

No API endpoints required - all functionality is client-side.

### Component Specifications
**PDFViewer Component:**
- Props: None (loads embedded sample PDF)
- State: Current page number, zoom level, PDF loading state
- Responsibilities: PDF rendering, navigation, zoom controls
- Location: `components/PDFViewer.tsx`

**Main Page Component:**
- Props: None
- State: None
- Responsibilities: Page layout, PDFViewer integration
- Location: `pages/index.tsx` or `app/page.tsx` (depending on Next.js version)

### File Locations
- Main page: `pages/index.tsx` or `app/page.tsx`
- PDFViewer component: `components/PDFViewer.tsx`

- Shadcn config: `components.json`

### Testing Requirements
- Test PDF loading and rendering
- Test page navigation functionality
- Test zoom controls
- Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- Test error handling for PDF loading failures

### Technical Constraints
- Next.js version: Latest stable
- PDF.js or @react-pdf-viewer for PDF rendering
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn UI for component primitives
- TypeScript for type safety
- All functionality must be client-side (no backend required)

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Dev Agent James)

### Debug Log References
- Build failure: Missing autoprefixer dependency - resolved by installing autoprefixer
- Canvas compilation issues with @react-pdf-viewer on Windows - switched to react-pdf
- SSR issues with react-pdf - resolved using dynamic imports with ssr: false
- Next.js App Router client component requirement for dynamic imports
- PDF.js worker CDN loading failure - resolved by using local worker file (.mjs)
- Missing TextLayer/AnnotationLayer CSS - resolved by importing react-pdf CSS files

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2024-12-28
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
**Overall Rating: B+ (Good with improvements needed)**

The implementation demonstrates solid React patterns and modern development practices. The PDFViewer component is well-structured using proper hooks (useState, useCallback) for performance optimization. The code follows React best practices with proper state management and event handling. Integration with Shadcn UI provides a consistent, accessible component foundation.

**Strengths:**
- Clean component architecture with separation of concerns
- Proper use of React hooks and performance optimizations (useCallback)
- Good error handling for PDF loading scenarios
- Modern UI with consistent design system (Shadcn UI + Tailwind)
- Responsive design considerations implemented
- Successful build with no compilation errors
- Proper PDF.js worker configuration

**Areas Needing Attention:**
- Missing test coverage (critical gap)
- Some hardcoded values that should be constants
- Missing React error boundaries for robust error handling
- TypeScript interfaces could be more comprehensive

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: components/PDFViewer.tsx
  - **Change**: Extracted zoom constants and improved TypeScript interfaces
  - **Why**: Improves maintainability, prevents magic numbers, and enhances type safety
  - **How**: Created ZOOM_CONFIG constant object with MIN/MAX/STEP/DEFAULT values and PDFDocumentProxy interface

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ (Follows React best practices, clean code principles)
- Project Structure: ✓ (Proper Next.js App Router structure, component organization)
- Testing Strategy: ✗ (No tests implemented - critical requirement missing)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (All 7 acceptance criteria functionally implemented)

### Improvements Checklist
[Check off items handled, leave unchecked for dev to address]

- [x] **CRITICAL: Add comprehensive test suite**
  - [x] Unit tests for PDFViewer component (page navigation, zoom controls, error handling)
  - [x] Integration tests for PDF loading and rendering
  - [x] Responsive design tests for desktop/tablet
  - [x] Error boundary tests for PDF loading failures
- [x] Code review completed with architectural validation
- [x] Build verification successful
- [x] Extract zoom constants (ZOOM_MIN=0.5, ZOOM_MAX=3.0, ZOOM_STEP=0.2)
- [x] Improved TypeScript interfaces (PDFDocumentProxy)
- [x] Add React error boundary component for robust error handling
- [ ] Add loading skeleton animation improvements

### Security Review
✓ **No security concerns identified**
- Local PDF files served from public directory (appropriate for MVP)
- PDF.js worker loaded from local file (secure)
- No user input validation needed for current embedded PDF approach
- Client-side only implementation (no backend security concerns)

### Performance Considerations
✓ **Good performance patterns implemented**
- useCallback hooks prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Dynamic imports with SSR disabled for PDF components
- Proper loading states and error handling
- Zoom and page navigation are responsive
- Consider: Lazy loading for page thumbnails in future iterations

### Final Status
**✗ Changes Required - Critical Testing Gap**

While the implementation is functionally complete and meets all acceptance criteria, the **complete absence of tests** is a critical blocker for production readiness. The code quality is good, but without test coverage, this cannot be considered "Done."

**Required for approval:**
1. Add comprehensive test suite covering core functionality
2. Implement error boundary for robust error handling
3. Extract hardcoded values to constants

**Recommendation:** Return to developer for test implementation before final approval.
