## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the first story in the project.

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story - PDF rendering is handled by PDF.js library.

### API Specifications
No API endpoints required - all functionality is client-side.

### Component Specifications
**PDFViewer Component:**
- Props: None (loads embedded sample PDF)
- State: Current page number, zoom level, PDF loading state
- Responsibilities: PDF rendering, navigation, zoom controls
- Location: `components/PDFViewer.tsx`

**Main Page Component:**
- Props: None
- State: None
- Responsibilities: Page layout, PDFViewer integration
- Location: `pages/index.tsx` or `app/page.tsx` (depending on Next.js version)

### File Locations
- Main page: `pages/index.tsx` or `app/page.tsx`
- PDFViewer component: `components/PDFViewer.tsx`
- Sample PDF: `public/sample.pdf`
- Tailwind config: `tailwind.config.js`
- Shadcn config: `components.json`

### Testing Requirements
- Test PDF loading and rendering
- Test page navigation functionality
- Test zoom controls
- Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- Test error handling for PDF loading failures

### Technical Constraints
- Next.js version: Latest stable
- PDF.js or @react-pdf-viewer for PDF rendering
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn UI for component primitives
- TypeScript for type safety
- All functionality must be client-side (no backend required)
