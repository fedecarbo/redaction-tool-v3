# Solution Overview & Architectural Goals

## Web-Based PDF Redaction Tool (MVP)

**Solution Overview:**  
The PDF Redaction Tool is a modern, in-browser web application built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI. It renders a sample multi-page PDF, allows users to select rectangular regions for redaction, and generates a new, fully redacted PDFâ€”all client-side, with no server or file uploads required.

**Architectural Goals:**
- Fully client-side: zero backend or storage; maximizes privacy and speeds up iteration.
- Maintain high performance and responsiveness for PDF viewing/redacting.
- Modular, testable, and maintainable component structure.
- Use established open-source libraries for PDF rendering and manipulation (PDF.js).
- Ensure "true" redaction (content in redacted regions is unrecoverable, not just visually hidden).
- Lay groundwork for potential future expansion (uploads, multi-file, backend, mobile, etc.).
